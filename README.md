# rock_paper_scisors_project

I will write down the steps I took to fullfil this project on this README.md file

# The Challenge

- The project asks that I create the simple rock, paper, scissors game that returns results in the console.
- The game should first be played for 1 round and declare a win or loss for the user
- The game should play for 5 rounds and should record and the results of each round and report either a win or a loss for the user
- The game should prompt the user for an input

# My Process

    - Understanding the problem:
        1) For the first step, I'll create a function called computerPlay() that randomly returns the strings
            "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"
        2) Next I'll write another function called playRound(playerSelection,computerSelection) that plays a single round of
            of the rock, paper, scissors and this function will return a string declaring the winner of the round
        3) For this step I'll write a function called game() that uses the function playRound() to play(loop or call) a 5 rounds
            and store the results of each round and finally reports a winner or loser
        4) Use prompt to get input from the user
